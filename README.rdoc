= work_log

== Description

A simple time tracker that logs your work times to a file using a command line interface.

== Installation

    sudo gem install work_log

The +work_log+ command should now be available in your command line interface.

== Usage

Currently +work_log+ supports the following arguments:

    work_log start    # Log that you started working.
                      # You can pass a starting time in human readable words, e.g.
                      # work_log start two hours ago
                      # Default time is DateTime.now
                      # Shorthand: work_log s

    work_log end      # Log that you finished working.
                      # You can also pass a time (see start)
                      # Shorthand: work_log e

    work_log all      # List all entries
                      # Shorthand: work_log a

    work_log week     # List the entries of the current week
                      # Shorthand: work_log w

    work_log last     # Show the last logged entry

    work_log since    # Show all entries since a given time, examples:
                      # work_log since yesterday
                      # work_log since 2 weeks ago

    work_log undo     # Removes the last entry from the log

=== Hint: Changing the location of the saved file

Especially interesting in combination with *Dropbox* to add backup/multiple device sync capabilities to work_log. ;)

Per default, the entries are saved in your home directory:

    ~/work_log.yml

But you can change location of the saved file by creating a file called <tt>.work_log_gem</tt> in your home directory.

    touch ~/.work_log_gem

And enter the following valid YAML (watch the indentation):

    logfile: "/Users/yourUserName/some/other/path/work_log.yml"

Note that this must be the absolute path to the file.
